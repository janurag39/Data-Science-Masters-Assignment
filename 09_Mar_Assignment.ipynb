Then we integrate x + 2 within the limits 0.5 and 1. This gives us 1.375. Thus, the probability that the continuous random variable lies between 0.5 and 1 is 1.375."

    "Ans. **Common Examples of situations where *Normal Distribution* can be applied:**\n",
    "1. Height: The height of people is an example of normal distribution. Most of the people in a specific population are of average height. The number of people taller and shorter than the average height people is almost equal, and a very small number of people are either extremely tall or extremely short. Several genetic and environmental factors influence height. Therefore, it follows the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rolling a Dice: A fair rolling of dice is also a good example of normal distribution. In an experiment, it has been found that when a dice is rolled 100 times, chances to get ‘1’ are 15-18% and if we roll the dice 1000 times, the chances to get ‘1’ is, again, the same, which averages to 16.7% (1/6). If we roll two dice simultaneously, there are 36 possible combinations. The probability of rolling ‘1’ (with six possible combinations) again averages to around 16.7%, i.e., (6/36). More the number of dice more elaborate will be the normal distribution graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. IQ: In this scenario of increasing competition, most parents, as well as children, want to analyze the Intelligent Quotient level. Well, the IQ of a particular population is a normal distribution curve; where the IQ of a majority of the people in the population lies in the normal range whereas the IQ of the rest of the population lives in the deviated range.\n",

    "4. Blood Pressure: Blood pressure generally follows a Gaussian distribution (normal) in the general population, and it makes Gaussian mixture models a suitable candidate for modelling blood pressure behaviour.\n",

    "**Parameters of the Normal Distribution that relates to its shape:**\n",
    "- The two main parameters of a (normal) distribution are the mean and standard deviation. The parameters determine the shape and probabilities of the distribution. The shape of the distribution changes as the parameter values change.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean: The mean is used by researchers as a measure of central tendency. It can be used to describe the distribution of variables measured as ratios or intervals. In a normal distribution graph, the mean defines the location of the peak, and most of the data points are clustered around the mean. Any changes made to the value of the mean move the curve either to the left or right along the X-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation measures the dispersion of the data points relative to the mean. It determines how far away from the mean the data points are positioned and represents the distance between the mean and the observations. On the graph, the standard deviation determines the width of the curve, and it tightens or expands the width of the distribution along the x-axis. Typically, a small standard deviation relative to the mean produces a steep curve, while a large standard deviation relative to the mean produces a flatter curve."

    "Ans. **Bernoulli distribution** is a discrete probability distribution where the Bernoulli random variable can have only 0 or 1 as the outcome. p is the probability of success and 1 - p is the probability of failure. The mean of a Bernoulli distribution is E[X] = p and the variance, Var[X] = p(1-p).\n",

    "A random variable follows a Bernoulli distribution if it only has two possible outcomes: 0 or 1. For example, suppose we flip a coin one time. Let the probability that it lands on heads be p. This means the probability that it lands on tails is 1-p.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, random variable X follows a Bernoulli distribution. It can only take on two possible values.\n",

    "For example, suppose we flip a coin 5 times and we want to know the probability of obtaining heads k times. We would say that the random variable X follows a Binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, When number of trial is 1, then Binomial Distribution is equivalent to Bernoulli Distribution but when number of trials are greater than 1 than its Binomial Distribution only.\n",

    "**Important Note**\n",
    "1. A random variables that follows a Bernoulli distribution can only take on two possible values, but a random variable that follows a Binomial distribution can take on several values. For example, in a single coin flip we will either have 0 or 1 heads. However, in a series of 5 coin flips we could have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In order for a random variable to follow a Binomial distribution, the probability of “success” in each Bernoulli trial must be equal and independent. For example, if we define “success” as landing on heads, then the probability of success on each coin flip is equal to 0.5 and each flip is independent – the outcome of one coin flip does not affect the outcome of another."

In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of a sample variable approximates a normal distribution (i.e., a “bell curve”) as the sample size becomes larger, assuming that all samples are identical in size, and regardless of the population's actual distribution shape. In other words, CLT is a statistical premise that, given a sufficiently large sample size from a population with a finite level of variance, the mean of all sampled variables from the same population will be approximately equal to the mean of the whole population. Furthermore, these samples approximate a normal distribution, with their variances being approximately equal to the variance of the population as the sample size gets larger, according to the law of large numbers.\n",

For example, investors can use central limit theorem to aggregate individual security performance data and generate distribution of sample means that represent a larger population distribution for security returns over a period of time."
