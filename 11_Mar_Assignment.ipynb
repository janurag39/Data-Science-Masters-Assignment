    "Ans. Key difference between Z-test and T-test.\n",
    "1. The t-test can be understood as a statistical test which is used to compare and analyse whether the means of the two population is different from one another or not when the standard deviation is not known. As against, Z-test is a parametric test, which is applied when the standard deviation is known, to determine, if the means of the two datasets differ from each other.\n",
    "2. The t-test is based on Student’s t-distribution. On the contrary, z-test relies on the assumption that the distribution of sample means is normal. Both student’s t-distribution and normal distribution appear alike, as both are symmetrical and bell-shaped. However, they differ in the sense that in a t-distribution, there is less space in the centre and more in the tails.\n",
    "3. One of the important conditions for adopting t-test is that population variance is unknown. Conversely, population variance should be known or assumed to be known in case of a z-test.\n",
    "4. Z-test is used to when the sample size is large, i.e. n > 30, and t-test is appropriate when the size of the sample is small, in the sense that n < 30.\n"

    "3. In a one-tailed test, the region of rejection is either on the left or right of the sampling distribution. On the contrary, the region of rejection is on both the sides of the sampling distribution.\n",

    "Ans. **Type 1 Error:**\n",
    "A Type I error means rejecting the null hypothesis when it’s actually true. It means concluding that results are statistically significant when, in reality, they came about purely by chance or because of unrelated factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk of committing this error is the significance level (alpha or α) you choose. That’s a value that you set at the beginning of your study to assess the statistical probability of obtaining your results (p value).\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance level is usually set at 0.05 or 5%. This means that your results only have a 5% chance of occurring, or less, if the null hypothesis is actually true.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p value of your test is lower than the significance level, it means your results are statistically significant and consistent with the alternative hypothesis. If your p value is higher than the significance level, then your results are considered statistically non-significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example for Type-1 Error:* In your clinical study, you compare the symptoms of patients who received the new drug intervention or a control treatment. Using a t test, you obtain a p value of .035. This p value is lower than your alpha of .05, so you consider your results statistically significant and reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "However, the p value means that there is a 3.5% chance of your results occurring if the null hypothesis is true. Therefore, there is still a risk of making a Type I error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type 2 Error:**\n",
    "A Type II error means not rejecting the null hypothesis when it’s actually false. This is not quite the same as “accepting” the null hypothesis, because hypothesis testing can only tell you whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, a Type II error means failing to conclude there was an effect when there actually was. In reality, your study may not have had enough statistical power to detect an effect of a certain size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Power is the extent to which a test can correctly detect a real effect when there is one. A power level of 80% or higher is usually considered acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk of a Type II error is inversely related to the statistical power of a study. The higher the statistical power, the lower the probability of making a Type II error.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example for Type-2 Error:* When preparing your clinical study, you complete a power analysis and determine that with your sample size, you have an 80% chance of detecting an effect size of 20% or greater. An effect size of 20% means that the drug intervention reduces symptoms by 20% more than the control treatment.\n",
    "However, a Type II may occur if an effect that’s smaller than this size. A smaller effect size is unlikely to be detected in your study due to inadequate statistical power."

    "Ans. **Bayes theorem** describes the probability of occurrence of an event related to any condition. It is also considered for the case of conditional probability. Bayes theorem is also known as the formula for the probability of “causes”.

In this case, the probability of occurrence of an event is calculated depending on other conditions is known as conditional probability.\n",
