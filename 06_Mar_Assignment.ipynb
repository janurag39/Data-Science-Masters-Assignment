    "Ans. Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. Statistics is a highly interdisciplinary field; research in statistics finds applicability in virtually all scientific fields and research questions in the various scientific fields motivate the development of new statistical methods and theory. In developing methods and studying the theory that underlies the methods statisticians draw on a variety of mathematical and computational tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two fundamental ideas in the field of statistics are uncertainty and variation. There are many situations that we encounter in science (or more generally in life) in which the outcome is uncertain. In some cases the uncertainty is because the outcome in question is not determined yet (e.g., we may not know whether it will rain tomorrow) while in other cases the uncertainty is because although the outcome has been determined already we are not aware of it (e.g., we may not know whether we passed a particular exam).\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is a mathematical language used to discuss uncertain events and probability plays a key role in statistics. Any measurement or data collection effort is subject to a number of sources of variation. By this we mean that if the same measurement were repeated, then the answer would likely change. Statisticians attempt to understand and control (where possible) the sources of variation in any situation."

    "Ans. **Different Types of Statistics:**\n",
    "1. **Descriptive statistics**: Descriptive statistics are used to describe the basic features of the data in a study. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures. Together with simple graphics analysis, they form the basis of virtually every quantitative analysis of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Descriptive Statistics are used to present quantitative descriptions in a manageable form. In a research study we may have lots of measures. Or we may measure a large number of people on any measure. Descriptive statistics help us to simplify large amounts of data in a sensible way. Each descriptive statistic reduces lots of data into a simpler summary. For instance, consider a simple number used to summarize how well a batter is performing in baseball, the batting average. This single number is simply the number of hits divided by the number of times at bat (reported to three significant digits). A batter who is hitting .333 is getting a hit one time in every three at bats. One batting .250 is hitting one time in four. The single number describes a large number of discrete events. Or, consider the scourge of many students, the Grade Point Average (GPA). This single number describes the general performance of a student across a potentially wide range of course experiences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Every time you try to describe a large set of observations with a single indicator you run the risk of distorting the original data or losing important detail. The batting average doesn’t tell you whether the batter is hitting home runs or singles. It doesn’t tell whether she’s been in a slump or on a streak. The GPA doesn’t tell you whether the student was in difficult courses or easy ones, or whether they were courses in their major field or in other disciplines. Even given these limitations, descriptive statistics provide a powerful summary that may enable comparisons across people or other units.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inferential Statistics**: With inferential statistics, you are trying to reach conclusions that extend beyond the immediate data alone. For instance, we use inferential statistics to try to infer from the sample data what the population might think. Or, we use inferential statistics to make judgments of the probability that an observed difference between groups is a dependable one or one that might have happened by chance in this study. Thus, we use inferential statistics to make inferences from our data to more general conditions; we use descriptive statistics simply to describe what’s going on in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Most of the major inferential statistics come from a general family of statistical models known as the General Linear Model. This includes the t-test, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), regression analysis, and many of the multivariate methods like factor analysis, multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, discriminant function analysis, and so on."

    "Ans. **Data Type in Statistics:**\n",
    "1. **Quantitative Data/Numerical Data**: Quantitative Data as the name suggests it can be quantified and have numerical data with mathematical meaning to it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Types of Numerical Data:\n",
    "    - *Discrete Data*: Data can be discrete if its values are distinct and separate. In other word, discrete data is the data can only take on certain values. This type of data can’t be measured but it can be counted. It basically represents information that can be categorized into a classification. An example is the number of heads in 100 coin flips.\n",
    "    - *Continuous Data*: Continuous data represents measurements and therefore their values can’t be counted but they can be measured. An example would be the height of a person, which you can describe by using intervals on the real number line.\n",
    "    - *Interval Data*: Interval values represent ordered units that have the same difference. Therefore we speak of interval data when we have a variable that contains numeric values that are ordered and where we know the exact differences between the values. An example would be a feature that contains temperature of a given place.\n",
    "        For Example: \n",
    "        - Temprature = [ -10, -5, 0, 5, 10 ]\n",
    "        \n",
    "        The problem with interval values data is that they don’t have a “true zero.” That means in regards to our example, that there is no such thing as no temperature. With interval data, we can add and subtract, but we cannot multiply, divide or calculate ratios. Because there is no true zero, a lot of descriptive and inferential statistics can’t be applied.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - *Ratio Data*: Ratio values are also ordered units that have the same difference. Ratio values are the same as interval values, with the difference that they do have an absolute zero. Good examples are height, weight, length, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Qualitative Data/Categorical Data**: Categorical data represents characteristics. Therefore it can represent things like a person’s gender, language, etc. Categorical data can also take on numerical values (Example: 1 for female and 0 for male) but those numbers don’t have mathematical meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Types of Categorical Data:\n",
    "    - *Nominal Data*: Nominal values represent discrete units and are used to label variables that have no quantitative value. Just think of them as “labels.” The nominal data that has no order. Therefore, if we would change the order of its values, the meaning would not change.\n",
    "        For Example:\n",
    "        - Gender\n",
    "        - Blood Group\n",
    "    - *Ordinal Data*: Ordinal values represent discrete and ordered units. It is therefore nearly the same as nominal data, except that its ordering/Ranking matters.\n",
    "        For Example:\n",
    "        - Education Background\n",

    "Ans. Levels of measurement, also called scales of measurement, tell you how precisely variables are recorded. In scientific research, a variable is anything that can take on different values across your data set (e.g., height or test scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 levels of measurement:\n",
    "- **Nominal**: the data can only be categorized\n",
    "- **Ordinal**: the data can be categorized and ranked\n",
    "- **Interval**: the data can be categorized, ranked, and evenly spaced\n",
    "- **Ratio**: the data can be categorized, ranked, evenly spaced, and has a natural zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the level of measurement of the variable, what you can do to analyze our data may be limited. There is a hierarchy in the complexity and precision of the level of measurement, from low (nominal) to high (ratio).\n",
    "\n",
    "Going from lowest to highest, the 4 levels of measurement are cumulative. This means that they each take on the properties of lower levels and add new properties.\n",
    "1. *Nominal Level*: We can categorize our data by labelling them in mutually exclusive groups, but there is no order between the categories.\n",
    "    For Example:\n",
    "    - Gender\n",
    "    - City of Birth\n",
    "    - Ethnicity\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. *Ordinal Level*: We can categorize and rank our data in an order, but cannot say anything about the intervals between the rankings. Although you can rank the top 5 Olympic medallists, this scale does not tell you how close or far apart they are in number of wins. \n",
    "    For Example:\n",
    "    - Language Ability\n",
    "    - Top 5 Olympic Medalist\n",
    "    \n",

The difference between any two adjacent temperatures is the same: one degree. But  zero degrees is defined differently depending on the scale – it doesn’t mean an absolute absence of temperature.\n",

The key difference between them is that the latter plots values on the X axis one by one, whereas the former, the Range Bar Chart type, depicts two values on the X axis at a time — Low and High. In Range Bar Charts, data points are built starting from the minimum values. As a result, each bar shows the difference between the maximum and minimum values in each corresponding category. A Range Bar Chart can display more than one series. If there are multiple series in such a graph, data points will be grouped by category, which is also very convenient for comparing several variables."

    "- **Descriptive statistics**: Descriptive statistics are used to describe the basic features of the data in a study. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures. Together with simple graphics analysis, they form the basis of virtually every quantitative analysis of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Descriptive Statistics are used to present quantitative descriptions in a manageable form. In a research study we may have lots of measures. Or we may measure a large number of people on any measure. Descriptive statistics help us to simplify large amounts of data in a sensible way. Each descriptive statistic reduces lots of data into a simpler summary. For instance, consider a simple number used to summarize how well a batter is performing in baseball, the batting average. This single number is simply the number of hits divided by the number of times at bat (reported to three significant digits). A batter who is hitting .333 is getting a hit one time in every three at bats. One batting .250 is hitting one time in four. The single number describes a large number of discrete events. Or, consider the scourge of many students, the Grade Point Average (GPA). This single number describes the general performance of a student across a potentially wide range of course experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Every time you try to describe a large set of observations with a single indicator you run the risk of distorting the original data or losing important detail. The batting average doesn’t tell you whether the batter is hitting home runs or singles. It doesn’t tell whether she’s been in a slump or on a streak. The GPA doesn’t tell you whether the student was in difficult courses or easy ones, or whether they were courses in their major field or in other disciplines. Even given these limitations, descriptive statistics provide a powerful summary that may enable comparisons across people or other units.\n",

    "- **Inferential Statistics**: With inferential statistics, you are trying to reach conclusions that extend beyond the immediate data alone. For instance, we use inferential statistics to try to infer from the sample data what the population might think. Or, we use inferential statistics to make judgments of the probability that an observed difference between groups is a dependable one or one that might have happened by chance in this study. Thus, we use inferential statistics to make inferences from our data to more general conditions; we use descriptive statistics simply to describe what’s going on in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Most of the major inferential statistics come from a general family of statistical models known as the General Linear Model. This includes the t-test, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), regression analysis, and many of the multivariate methods like factor analysis, multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, discriminant function analysis, and so on."
